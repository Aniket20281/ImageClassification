# ImageClassification

Performed classification task on the cifar10 dataset. I performed feature extraction on images by converting them to pixel matrices. Feature Scaling and dimensionality reduction using PCA was done. I tried different machine learning algorithms with grid-search for hyper-parameter tuning and reached a accuracy of 70 percent.
